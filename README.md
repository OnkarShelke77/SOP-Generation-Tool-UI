# SOP-Generation-Tool-UI
I created a web-based Statement of Purpose (SOP) Generation Tool with the following features: -
                             
                                        Tech Stack Used:

1. Front-end: HTML for the user interface.
2. CSS for styling the UI elements.
3. Node.js and Express.js for the server-side logic.
4. Nodemailer for sending emails.
5. JavaScript for handling form submissions and interactions.

                                         Design Practices:

1. The web interface is designed with user-friendly forms.
2. Implemented proper form validation to ensure data integrity.
3. Styled the UI elements for an attractive and responsive design.
4. Used radio buttons and labels for a user-friendly "Yes" and "No" option selection.
5. Followed best practices for code organization and structure.

                                         Functionality:

1. Users can enter their personal information and answer questions.
2. The data is sent to the server using a POST request.
3. The server processes the data and generates a customized SOP.
4. An email with the SOP is sent to the user's provided email address.
5. Proper error handling and logging are implemented for reliability.

This implementation showcases skills in front-end development, back-end development, form handling, email sending, and design practices. 
It provides a user-friendly tool for generating SOPs while maintaining data security and a visually appealing user interface.
